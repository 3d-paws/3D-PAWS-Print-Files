## Printing Recommendations

### Filament Choice
We recommend using a high-quality ASA filament for optimal results. ASA is an excellent alternative to ABS, offering improved weather resistance, UV resistance, and excellent mechanical properties, making it ideal for outdoor applications like weather stations.

Recommended filament: 
- PolyLite‚Ñ¢ ASA by Polymaker (https://us.polymaker.com/products/polylite-asa)
- Overture (https://overture3d.com/collections/all-filaments/products/overture-asa-filament-1-75mm)

### Print Settings
- **Nozzle Temperature:** 240¬∞C - 260¬∞C
- **Bed Temperature:** 75¬∞C - 95¬∞C
- **Print Speed:** 30mm/s - 50mm/s
- **Cooling Fan:** Off
- **Infill:** 99-100% (to improve strength and reduce water absorption)

### Additional Tips
1. Use an enclosure to maintain a stable printing environment, ideally with an ambient temperature between 35¬∞C - 45¬∞C.
2. Print on a textured PEI sheet or use polyimide tape for better adhesion.
3. Adding a 5mm brim can significantly improve bed adhesion.
4. For large or thin models, printing in an enclosure or heated chamber is highly recommended.

## About 3DPAWS
The 3DPAWS initiative increases meteorological observations by enabling local construction of weather stations. Using 3D-printed parts makes weather monitoring more accessible and cost-effective for developing countries and rural communities.
